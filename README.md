# Donation Tracker
(Banking for Humanity Hackathon, Oct 1, 2016)

Children crowd-source donations for various causes from friends and family - often the parents are the ones doing ALL the work (communicating and tracking progress). Our solution is to gradually reduce the involvement of the parents from the mix and make the kids more responsible and handle the entire effort "almost" by themselves. The school or the parents should be overseers of the process to maintain a conducive environment for kids to interact with other adults. The main goal of the app should be to teach kids to set goals, track progress, compare performances across different crowd-souring efforts, learn to communicate with adults, send thank-you notes and keep track of lessons learned. The historical information of the various causes the person has been involved with in their growing years - all in one place!
